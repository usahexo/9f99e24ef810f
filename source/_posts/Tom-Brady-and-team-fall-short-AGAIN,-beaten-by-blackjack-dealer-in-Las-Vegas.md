#  Tom Brady and team fall short AGAIN, beaten by blackjack dealer in Las Vegas

In one of the most stunning defeats in recent memory, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots have fallen to a blackjack dealer at a Las Vegas casino.

The team was in town for a preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles, but found themselves on the wrong side of a dealer's 20.

"We just couldn't catch a break," said Brady after the game. "It seemed like every card we drew was bad."

The loss was especially bitter for Brady, who has a well-known love of gambling. The quarterback had been seen earlier in the day putting his money down on blackjack and roulette tables.

"I thought I had this one in the bag," said Brady. "But I guess that blackjack dealer just wanted to beat me."

The defeat comes as a major blow to Brady and the Patriots, who are already considered longshots to win this year's Super Bowl.

#  Tom Brady's gambling addiction continues to cost the Patriots victories

In the wake of the Patriots' Deflategate scandal,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Tom Brady's gambling addiction has come to light. The embattled quarterback has a long history of betting on sports, and his habit has cost the Patriots numerous wins and millions of dollars.

Last year, in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Brady placed a large bet on the team to win. When the Eagles upset the Patriots, Brady was out over $1 million. In another game against the Indianapolis Colts in 2009, Brady placed a $100,000 bet on the Colts - and they lost.

These losses have cost the Patriots dearly - they've missed out on playoff appearances and Super Bowl appearances because of Brady's gambling addiction. And it doesn't look like things are going to change anytime soon; in fact, Brady may be even more addicted to gambling than ever before.

Earlier this year, he was caught betting on college football games while he was at Gillette Stadium. And just last week, he placed a $10,000 bet on the Steelers to win the Super Bowl. It's clear that Tom Brady's gambling addiction is out of control - and it's costing the Patriots victories on the field.

#  Patriots blown out by blackjack dealer in Las Vegas

The New England Patriots were blown out by a blackjack dealer at the Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas on Sunday night.

The dealer, who identified himself only as "Jason," was apparently feeling lucky and decided to take on the NFL's best team. He started off strong, winning the first three hands of blackjack against Tom Brady and the Pats.

"We had no chance," said Brady after the game. "That dealer was on fire."

The Patriots never recovered, eventually losing by a score of 21-3. The loss drops New England to 6-2 on the season, with both losses coming against teams from Las Vegas.

"I'm not sure what happened," said head coach Bill Belichick after the game. "We just didn't execute well tonight."

The defeat is also costly for the Patriots, as they will now have to travel to Las Vegas to face the Raiders next week.

#  New England Patriots can't win when it counts, again

For the second year in a row, the New England Patriots have come up short in the AFC Championship game. The Patriots, who are usually a lock for the Super Bowl, just can't seem to win when it counts.

Last year, the Patriots were blown out by the Denver Broncos. This year, they lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars. In both cases, the Patriots were favored to win.

Why can't the Patriots win when it counts? There are several possible explanations:

1. The Patriots are a good team, but they're not good enough to win in the playoffs.

2. The Patriots are a good team, but they're not as good as their opponents.

3. The Patriots choke in big games.

4. The Patriots are held back by their coach, Bill Belichick.

5. The Patriots are a victim of "The Curse of Bobby Brady."

Which explanation is right? It's hard to say for sure. But one thing is clear: The New England Patriots can't win when it counts.

#  Blackjack dealer beats Patriots for second time this season

In a stunning turn of events, the blackjack dealer once again beats the New England Patriots. This is the second time this season that the dealer has managed to outsmart the team. The first time was in early October, when the dealer managed to win with a final score of 21 against the Pats’ 20.

The latest game, which took place on Sunday evening, was much closer, with the dealer eventually winning by a margin of just 1 point. With a final score of 22 against 21, it was an excruciating defeat for the Patriots.

This latest loss is sure to be a bitter one for New England fans, who had high hopes for their team this year. It also casts doubt on the Pats’ chances of making it to the Super Bowl this year; something that seemed like a very real possibility just a few weeks ago.

For the blackjack dealer, however, this latest victory is sure to be cause for celebration. After all, it’s not every day that you manage to beat one of America’s top football teams twice in a row.
