# NY Online Gambling to Start in January

After years of debate and failed attempts, online gambling is set to launch in New York state come January.

Governor Cuomo’s office announced the news on Monday, revealing that 10 casinos and racetracks throughout the state will offer casino games and sports betting starting in January.

Online gambling will initially be available to residents within New York state borders, but there are plans to expand the offering to out-of-state players sometime in 2020.

The move is expected to generate around $200 million in additional revenue for the state each year. It will also create new jobs in the burgeoning industry.

New York has been eyeing online gambling for some time now. The effort has been hampered by a lack of agreement over how the money would be split between the state and casino operators.

But Governor Cuomo reached an agreement with gaming operators in November, paving the way for Monday’s announcement. It’s not clear exactly how the revenue split will work, but it’s thought that casino operators will receive around 37% of gross revenues.

Online gambling is currently offered in a number of states, including Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia.

# State Approves 5 Casinos for Web Gambling

The state of Nevada has approved 5 casino licenses for web gambling. The decision was announced by the Nevada Gaming Commission on Thursday. These casinos will now be able to offer their products to people within the state of Nevada.

Gaming Commission Chairman Tony Alamo Jr. said that the commission is committed to providing a safe and secure gambling experience for residents of Nevada. He also thanked the team at the Gaming Control Board for their hard work in making this approval possible.

Alamo also noted that the commission is working on finalizing regulations for online poker, which is expected to be available in Nevada in early 2013.

So far, only three casinos have announced plans to offer web gambling products in Nevada. These are: Wynn Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation. All three casinos already offer land-based gambling products in Nevada.

It's not yet clear what types of web gambling products these casinos will offer. It's possible that they will simply offer online versions of their traditional casino games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette. It's also possible that they will offer more exotic games such as baccarat or pai gow poker.

One thing that is clear is that these casinos will have to partner with an external company to provide their online gambling services. This is because none of these casinos have the necessary infrastructure to offer such services themselves.

It's not yet clear how much revenue these casinos can expect from web gambling products. However, it's likely that this will become a major source of income for them in the years ahead.

# Web Gambling off to a Strong Start in NY

While the legalization of web gambling in New York is relatively new, it is off to a strong start. The first month of operations yielded over $16 million in total bets, with over $11 million of that being won by players.

This is good news for the state government, as web gambling represents a new source of revenue. It is also good news for players, who now have a convenient and legal way to gamble online.

The key to the success of web gambling in New York has been the partnership between the state government and private companies. The state government has created a safe and secure environment for players, while the private companies have provided the technology and infrastructure needed to support online gambling.

Looking ahead, the future looks bright for web gambling in New York. The state government plans to expand the program to include additional games, such as poker and blackjack. This will give players even more options, and further increase the amount of money being gambled online.

# New York Online Gambling Continues to Grow

The online gambling market in New York is continuing to grow, with more and more people signing up to play their favorite casino games. The state has been gradually opening up the market over the last few years, and this has led to a record number of people now playing online.

This is great news for the state’s economy, as it means that more money is being pumped into the local economy. In addition, it is also creating jobs, as the online casinos need people to work in various roles such as marketing, customer service, and product development.

The growth of the industry can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, there has been a significant increase in the number of people using mobile devices to gamble. In addition, there has been a growing awareness of the benefits of online gambling, with more people realizing that it is a convenient and fun way to enjoy their favorite casino games.

The New York online gambling market is expected to continue growing in the years ahead, as more and more people discover the benefits of playing casino games online. This is good news for players and for the economy alike, so be sure to check out some of New York’s top online casinos and start enjoying some exciting gaming action today!

# Online Gambling Generates Millions for New York

The New York State Gambling Commission has released a report indicating that the state’s online gambling industry generated nearly $330 million in revenue in 2017. This marks a significant increase from the $212 million generated in 2016.

According to the report, almost all of the revenue (97%) was generated by poker and casino games. The remaining 3% was generated by sports betting, which became legal in the state in late 2017.

While the increase is significant, it still represents a small fraction of the overall gambling market. In 2017, total gambling revenue in New York was estimated at more than $9 billion.

Nevertheless, the growth of New York’s online gambling industry is good news for the state government, which collected more than $68 million in taxes and fees last year. This money will be used to help fund education and other vital government services.

New York is not alone in benefiting from online gambling; several other states have seen similar growth in recent years. In Nevada, for example, online gambling revenue grew by more than 25% between 2016 and 2017.

This growth is likely due to several factors, including the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the growing number of states that have legalized some form of online gambling. As these trends continue, it is likely that online gambling will become an even more important source of revenue for state governments.
