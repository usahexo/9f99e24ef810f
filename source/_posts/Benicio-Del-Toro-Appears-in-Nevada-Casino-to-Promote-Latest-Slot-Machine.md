#  Benicio Del Toro Appears in Nevada Casino to Promote Latest Slot Machine

Actor Benicio Del Toro made a promotional appearance at the Nevada casino The Cromwell this week to promote a new slot machine game in which he stars. Dressed casually in a white T-shirt and blue jeans, the Puerto Rican actor greeted fans and gave interviews to the media about the new game, which is based on his 2015 film “Sicario.”

Asked about his experience of working on the new game, Del Toro replied: “It was great. The first time I saw it, I was really blown away. It’s like being in a movie.” He added that he hoped players would enjoy the game as much as he had enjoyed making it.
