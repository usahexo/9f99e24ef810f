It provides a harmless outlet for people to gamble without having to go to underground venues or risk getting ripped off by organized crime syndicates. And when it’s done responsibly, it can be a major source of revenue for state and local governments.

Just look at Las Vegas. For decades, it was known as the “Sin City” of America, thanks in large part to its legalized gambling industry. But over time, Vegas has become much more than just a place to gamble. It’s now one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, thanks to its world-famous casinos, resorts, and nightlife.

So if you’re worried about the social effects of legalized gambling, don’t be. It can be a positive thing for society as long as it’s properly regulated.
