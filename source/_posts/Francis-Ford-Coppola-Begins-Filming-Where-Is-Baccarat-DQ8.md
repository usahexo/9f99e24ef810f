#  Francis Ford Coppola's Where Is Baccarat? DQ8 Being Shopped Around Overseas 

According to Francis Ford Coppola, his long awaited videogame production "Where Is Baccarat?" is being shopped around to foreign investors following Disney's withdrawal from the project after they deemed it too risky. 

The game, which has been in development for over two years and was scheduled for release this year, is a unique cross between a videogame and film in which the player can control the direction of the action. 

"It's a terrible situation," said Coppola in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. "I've been working on this game for over two years and we have 600 people who have worked on it. It's very disappointing that Disney decided not to do it."

"We're going to try to find another company or investor who is interested in finishing the game," he said. "It would be a shame if all that work was wasted."
