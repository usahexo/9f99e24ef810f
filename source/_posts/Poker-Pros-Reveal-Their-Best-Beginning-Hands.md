#  Poker Pros Reveal Their Best Beginning Hands

There’s no question that the early stages of a poker hand are important, and the cards you are dealt can make a big difference. That’s why knowing which hands to play in the beginning is key to winning more often.

Here are the five best starting hands in Texas Hold’em, according to some of the top poker pros in the world:

Ace-King: This hand is considered by many to be the best possible starting hand in Texas Hold’em. With two high cards and a potential straight or flush draw, Ace-King can give you a strong edge early on in the hand.

Ace-Queen: Another high pair, Ace-Queen has good potential for both a straight and a flush. It’s also a strong hand against most other starting hands.

Ace-Jack: A good hand for catching up when you’re behind, Ace-Jack also has potential for a straight or flush draw.

King-Queen: Another powerful pair, King-Queen can give you a good chance at either taking down the pot or at least putting a lot of pressure on your opponents.

Ten-Jack: A “lower” pair like Ten-Jack can still be very powerful if played correctly. With two high cards, this hand has potential for both a straight and a flush.

#  What Are the Best Starting Hands in Poker?

There are no sure things in poker, but some hands are better than others. In this article, we'll take a look at the best starting hands in poker and give you some tips on how to play them.

The best starting hand in poker is A-A. This hand gives you a strong chance of winning the pot, and it's also very difficult for your opponents to beat. If you're dealt A-A, try to get all the money into the pot as soon as possible.

Other strong starting hands include K-K, Q-Q, J-J, and T-T. These hands have a high chance of winning against most other hands, so be aggressive with them.

That being said, you don't want to just blindly bet and raise with any of these hands. There are times when it's best to fold them, especially if the odds are against you. For example, if you're up against two opponents and they both have high cards like Ace or King, it's probably best to fold your hand and wait for a better opportunity.

In general, you want to be aggressive with your good hands and conservative with your bad hands. This will help you win more pots and increase your chances of taking down the pot at the end.

There are many different starting hands in poker, but not all of them are created equal. Here are the 10 best starting hands, in order of strength:

#  5 Best Poker Hands to Start With

In poker, the strength of your hand is all-important. You want to start with the best hands, so that you can progress through the game and hopefully take down the pot. Here are five of the best hands to start with in poker:

1. Aces

Aces are always a strong hand, no matter what variant of poker you’re playing. If you’re lucky enough to get dealt two aces, you’re almost guaranteed to win the hand. However, even if you don’t have two aces, any pair of aces is still a strong hand.

2. Kings

Kings are another powerful starting hand in poker. With four potential winning cards and only one potential losing card, kings give you a good chance of taking down the pot.

3. Queens

Queens are another solid starting hand in poker. They have three potential winning cards and two potential losing cards, making them a relatively safe option.

4. Jacks

Jacks are another strong starting hand in poker, thanks to their four potential winning cards. They also have one potential losing card, making them less risky than some other hands but still a good option to choose from.

5. Tens or Better

Tens or better is one of the weakest hands that you can start with in poker, but it’s still better than nothing. With two potential winning cards and three potential losing cards, tens or better gives you at least some chance of taking down the pot.
