There are many features that will be new as part of the renovation project. Perhaps the most exciting is the new Grand Atrium, which will be the focal point of the building. It will be a spacious, airy space with a glass ceiling and walls, and a grand staircase leading up to the second level.

Another major change is that all of the guest rooms will be completely renovated and redesigned. They will have contemporary decor and furniture, plus all of the latest amenities. The bathrooms will also be updated with modern fixtures and luxurious spa-style baths.
