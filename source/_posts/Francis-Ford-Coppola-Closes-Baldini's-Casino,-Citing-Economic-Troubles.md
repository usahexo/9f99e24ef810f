#  Francis Ford Coppola Closes Baldini's Casino, Citing Economic Troubles

Baldini's Casino in Las Vegas has been closed by its owner, Francis Ford Coppola, who cited economic troubles as the reason for the closure. The casino, which is located in the Resort at Summerlin, will lay off its more than 350 employees.

"This was a difficult decision to make, but it is necessary in order to preserve the long-term viability of our business," said Coppola in a statement.

Coppola purchased Baldini's Casino in late 2012 for $11 million. At the time, he said that he planned to invest an additional $30 million into the property. However, it appears that those plans have now been scrapped.

The closure of Baldini's Casino is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the Las Vegas gaming industry. In recent months, both the Fontainebleau and Riviera casinos have closed their doors.

#  Former Owner of Baldini's Casino Says He Lost $1 Million

 Reno, Nevada -- The former owner of Baldini's Casino said he lost $1 million when the casino went bankrupt in 2009.

In a deposition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Reno, Frank Fertitta said he pumped more than $1 million into the casino from 2006 to 2008 in an effort to save it from closing.

The casino closed in January 2009, resulting in the loss of about 400 jobs.

Fertitta said he was never repaid the money he lost and is still owed about $500,000.

Baldini's Casino was one of several businesses owned by developer and former NFL quarterback Mark Brunell. Brunell filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, listing Baldini's Casino and other businesses as liabilities.
