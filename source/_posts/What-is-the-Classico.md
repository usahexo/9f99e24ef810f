#  What is the Classico?
The Classico is an annual football match contested between the two most successful clubs in Italy, Juventus and Milan. The rivalry between the two clubs is widely considered to be one of the strongest in world football.

The match is so named as it was originally contested by the winners of the Serie A championship. However, from 2004–05 onwards, the match has been contested by the winners of the Coppa Italia (Italian Cup).

The first match was played on 8 May 1933 at the Stadio Mussolini in Rome. Juventus emerged victorious with a 2–1 victory. The most recent meeting, which took place on 22 December 2016 at the San Siro, saw Milan win 3–2.

#  What is the Classico Game?

The Classico Game is a variation of the game of soccer which is played between the two most successful clubs in Italy, Juventus and A.C. Milan. The name "Classico" was coined in the 1930s by journalist Gianni Brera, who used it to describe the derby match between A.C. Milan and Internazionale.

The first official meeting between Juventus and A.C. Milan took place on 8th November 1898, ending in a 1-1 draw. However, it was not until 1931 that the rivalry intensified, when A.C. Milan were promoted to Serie A for the first time in their history, while Juventus had been playing in the top division since its creation in 1929. The first derby played at the San Siro saw 33,000 fans pack into the stadium, with both teams sharing the spoils in a 0-0 draw.

The Classico has been historically dominated by Juventus, with 57 wins to A.C. Milan's 41 (36 draws), however it has been much more closely contested in recent years; with 5 wins each since 2007/08 season (10 draws). The fixture has also been known for its highly entertaining style of play, as well as its dramatic moments; such as Paolo Maldini's last minute equaliser in Doha which sent the 2003/2004 Champions League semi final into extra time (A.C Milan went on to lose on penalties). 

Juventus currently lead the all-time Serie A table with 102 titles to their name (A. C Milan are second with 18), while they are also unbeaten against their rivals in their last 15 meetings; including a 2-1 victory earlier this season at the San Siro Stadium thanks to goals from Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain

#  What is the Classico Ligue1 2022?

The Classico Ligue1 is the name of the annual football match contested between French clubs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Olympique de Marseille (OM). It is considered as one of the most emblematic derbies in world football.

The first edition took place on 2 May 1971, at the Parc des Princes. OM emerged victorious that day, with a 2–1 scoreline. The rivalry between the two clubs has intensified since PSG's ascension to the top level of French football in the early 1990s.

The fixture has been characterized by its intensity, as well as its spectacular goals and incidents. The Classico is often cited as one of the most passionate derbies in world football. 

# PSG v OM: A Rivalry Born in 1971

The origins of the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille can be traced back to 1971, when the two clubs met for the first time in what would come to be known as the Classico Ligue1. At that time, OM were reigning French champions, while PSG were still a relatively new club having only been founded 10 years earlier in 1970. 

The match was played at the Parc des Princes in front of a crowd of over 41,000 fans. It was OM who would take an early lead through Bernard Bosquier, but PSG would fight back and equalize through Georges Carnus before half-time. In the second half it was OM who would take control and secure a 2-1 victory thanks to goals from Josip Skoblar and Jean Tigana. 

 # The Classico intensifies in the 90s

It was not until after PSG's ascent to Ligue 1 in 1992 that the rivalry between these two clubs really began to intensify. With their new found wealth thanks to ambitious president Charles Hoarau, PSG began to challenge OM for dominance of French football.  This led to some fiery matches between the two sides which often ended with both teams receiving red cards. 

One such match occurred during the 1994-95 season when PSG travelled to Marseille for a league fixture on 21 January 1995. The game turned out to be a feisty affair with both teams receiving red cards late on in proceedings. Marseille eventually won the match 2-0 thanks to goals from Fabrizio Ravanelli and Franck Sauzée, but it was PSG who came away with most of the plaudits after putting up a spirited fight against ten men for almost 90 minutes. 

Another infamous meeting between these two sides took place during the 2001-02 season in what became known as Le Classico des Chicans (the Chicanos’ Derby). The match was played at Stade Vélodrome on 14 April 2002 and finished with a 3-2 victory for Marseille. However, this game will be remembered more for all ofthe scuffles which broke out both on and offthe pitch than for any ofthe goals scored. 
It was during this game that David Beckham received his notorious red card for kicking out at then-Marseille player Marco Simone following an altercation between the two players. This encounter also saw Zinedine Zidane clash heads with Didier Drogba resultingin Drogba being knocked unconscious – an injury which required eight stitchesto close!

#  How can I play the Classic game?

From the early days of computing there have been classic games that people love to play. One of the most popular is the card game Classic, also known as Klondike or patience. Here we will show you how to play this game on your computer.

## Step 1: Download the game First you need to download the game which can be found at http://www.Classicgameclub.com/downloads/. Make sure you save the file to your computer and not run it from the website.

## Step 2: Extract the files Once you have downloaded the file, extract it to a location on your computer. This will create a new folder called Classic which contains all of the game files.

## Step 3: Start the game Now open the Classic folder and then double-click on the file called Classic.exe to start playing.

The first thing you will see is a prompt for your name. Enter your name and then click OK. The game will now start and display four cards, one at a time, in the top left corner of the screen. Your goal is to move these cards to the four slots in the bottom right corner of the screen by clicking and dragging them with your mouse cursor.

You can only move one card at a time and can only place a card if its value is one more than the card that is currently in that slot. For example, if you have a three of clubs in one slot, you can place either a four of clubs or a two of spades since they are both next in sequence. Kings can be placed in any slot since they are worth 13 points.

If you get stuck, you can press the Hint button in the bottom right corner of the screen to get help from the computer. However, this will cost you 100 points so use it sparingly! If you run out of points, you can press Pause and then Restore Game to start again with 1000 points.
