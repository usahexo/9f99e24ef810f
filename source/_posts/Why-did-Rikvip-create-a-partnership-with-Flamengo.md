# Why did Rikvip create a partnership with Flamengo?

Rikvip is a Malaysian-based company that creates a virtual private network (VPN) and messaging app. The app is designed to allow users to communicate anonymously and securely. Rikvip announced its partnership with Flamengo, a Brazilian football club, in October of 2017.

The partnership was created with the goal of promoting Flamengo in Malaysia and increasing awareness of the club among fans in the region. Rikvip is also working with Flamengo to develop a new mobile app for the club. The app will be available in both English and Portuguese and will offer exclusive content to fans.

Rikvip CEO David Garrido said that the partnership is a “perfect match” and that he is excited to work with Flamengo. Garrido added that the company plans to support other Brazilian clubs in the future.

Flamengo Vice President Wallim Vasconcellos said that the club is happy to partner with Rikvip. Vasconcellos added that the partnership will help Flamengo expand its reach globally.

# What does Francis Ford Coppola have to do with this partnership?

The partnership between Marvel and Netflix can be seen as a match made in heaven. After all, who wouldn't want to see their favorite superheroes on the small screen? However, it wasn't always this way.

Marvel was actually close to a deal with Fox to create a Daredevil series. However, the rights for the character reverted back to Marvel Studios, leading to the partnership with Netflix. At first, it seemed like an odd choice for Marvel. Why would they partner with a streaming service when they had just partnered with ABC for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

It turns out that Netflix was actually the only one willing to take on the risk of doing a series based on such a dark and gritty character as Daredevil. Fox was interested in doing a PG-13 version of the character, while Netflix wanted to do something faithful to the comic books.

Enter Francis Ford Coppola. The director is known for his work on classic films such as The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. However, he is also no stranger to television, having directed episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and The West Wing.

Coppola was brought on board as an executive producer for Daredevil and he has been instrumental in making sure that the show stays true to the comics. He has worked closely with both Marvel and Netflix to make sure that each episode feels like a chapter in a larger story arc.

This partnership has been a huge success and Marvel has since announced collaborations with Netflix for several other series, including Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. It's safe to say that without Francis Ford Coppola, we might not be getting these amazing shows!
