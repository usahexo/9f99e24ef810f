#  Dallas Mavericks the Favorites to Win it All According to Sports Betting
<!-- Begin PlaceHolders -->

The Dallas Mavericks are the favorites to win it all this year, according to sports betting. The Mavericks have odds of +450 to win the NBA Finals, putting them ahead of the Golden State Warriors (+650) and the Cleveland Cavaliers (+1400).

Led by superstar Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks had a strong season last year, finishing with a record of 52-30. However, they were ultimately eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Houston Rockets. This year, they are looking to make a deeper run and bring home their first NBA championship.

The Golden State Warriors had an even better season last year, finishing with a record of 67-15. However, they too were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, this time by the Memphis Grizzlies. With Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson leading the way, they are looking to make a comeback this year and finally win an NBA championship.

The Cleveland Cavaliers had an awful season last year, finishing with a record of 33-49. However, with LeBron James back on the team, they are expected to make a big comeback this year. Oddsmakers have them as one of the favorites to win it all, with odds of +1400.

#  Las Vegas Set to Make a Killing from World Cup Betting

As the World Cup edges closer, and speculation around who will make it through to the latter stages intensifies, so too does discussion around where people can place their bets. The betting industry is big business, and nowhere is this more apparent than in Las Vegas.

This week, MGM Resorts announced that they would be expanding the range of World Cup betting options available to their customers. This follows on from news earlier in the year that Caesars Entertainment Corporation planned to offer a wide range of bets on the World Cup, including in-play options for those looking to make a quick buck.

Unsurprisingly, given Nevada's history with gambling, both companies are expecting big things from World Cup betting. In fact, sources quoted by the Las Vegas Review-Journal suggest that overall gambling revenue related to the World Cup could reach as high as $1 billion. That's a lot of money - and it's no wonder that Vegas is doing everything it can to get a slice of the action.

For those wanting to take advantage of the increased betting options in Las Vegas, there are plenty of places where you can do so. MGM Resorts' properties include some of Nevada's biggest casinos, including Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. Caesars Entertainment also operates a number of major casinos in Las Vegas, including Caesars Palace and The Linq.

If you're not based in Nevada, don't worry - you can still get in on the action. Online bookmakers such as Bet365 offer a wide range of World Cup betting options, including many of the same bets offered by casinos in Las Vegas. So whether you're planning on travelling to Sin City or not, there's no excuse not to get involved in some World Cup gambling this summer!

#  Records Could be Broken as Sports Betting Gets Heated for the World Cup

As the much-anticipated World Cup tournament heats up, so too does sports betting around the world. In anticipation of some of the biggest games yet to come, online sportsbooks are reporting record-breaking numbers in terms of wagers placed.

Leading UK bookmaker William Hill has already taken in £50 million ($67 million) in World Cup bets since the tournament began a month ago. And with so many high-stakes matchups still ahead - including Brazil vs. Belgium on Friday and France vs. Argentina next Tuesday - that number is only expected to grow.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has reported that sports betting revenue for June 2018 was up 20% from the same month last year. That's partly due to an influx of bets placed on this year's World Cup, with fans shelling out over $158 million on soccer matches thus far.

It's clear that the World Cup is capturing the attention of bettors all over the globe, and as the stakes continue to rise, so too could the records set for wagering. Whether you're placing a few bucks on your home country or laying down some serious cash on a longshot, there's plenty of excitement to be had in watching this year's tournament unfold. So don't miss out - place your bets now and see if you can make some history yourself!

#  Soccer Fans can Bet on their Favorite Team at Las Vegas Sportsbooks

In the era of legalized sports betting, soccer fans now have the opportunity to place wagers on their favorite clubs both in Las Vegas and online. While this was once only a dream for American soccer enthusiasts, the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn the federal ban on sports gambling has opened up a wide range of new betting opportunities.

The popular global sport of soccer is now available for legal wagering at Nevada sportsbooks, with a variety of propositions available for each match. This includes bets on the game's outcome, as well as detailed props such as first goal scorer, number of cards issued, and even how many corners will be taken.

For those who want to bet on their favorite club when they're not watching them in person, several online sportsbooks now offer betting on soccer games. This includes DraftKings, which offers odds for dozens of international leagues as well as Major League Soccer in the United States.

Beyond simply betting on who will win or lose a game, there are a wealth of unique prop bets that can spice up your wagering experience. For instance, you can bet on whether either team will score in the first 10 minutes of the match or whether there will be a sending off. You can also bet on how long it will take for the first goal to be scored and whether there will be any overtime played.

As more and more states legalize sports gambling in the coming years, it's likely that we'll see even more options available for betting on soccer games. So if you're looking for some extra excitement when watching your favorite club play live or on TV, make sure to check out the latest betting lines at your local sportsbook or online!
