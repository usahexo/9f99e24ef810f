They are moving their gambling capital from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This is a big move for the Clippers, as they look to improve on their performance from last season. The move is also a big one for the city of Los Angeles, as it now has two major gambling destinations.</p>
<p>The Lakers have long been the dominant team in Los Angeles, but with the Clippers now making a big play for the city’s gambling dollars, things could start to change.</p>
<p>The Clippers’ new stadium will be a major draw for gamblers. It will have state-of-the-art facilities and will be one of the most luxurious stadiums in all of sports.</p>
<p>This move is part of a broader strategy by the Clippers to become a major player in the world of professional sports. They want to compete with teams like the Lakers and the Celtics for fans and sponsorships.</p>
<p>The Clippers are hoping that their new stadium will help them attract top players and coaches to their team. They believe that by becoming a major destination for gambling, they can become one of the top teams in the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Team-Plans-Mega-Casino-Resort-in-L-A-3-Clippers-Bet-Big-on-New-Las-Vegas-Style-Casino-Resort"><a href="#NBA-Team-Plans-Mega-Casino-Resort-in-L-A-3-Clippers-Bet-Big-on-New-Las-Vegas-Style-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="NBA Team Plans Mega Casino Resort in L.A.3. Clippers Bet Big on New Las Vegas-Style Casino Resort"></a>NBA Team Plans Mega Casino Resort in L.A.3. Clippers Bet Big on New Las Vegas-Style Casino Resort</h1><p>The LA Clippers have announced plans for a new mega casino resort in L.A. that is expected to rival Las Vegas-style gambling resorts. The $1.2 billion project will be built on the site of the old Hollywood Park Racetrack and is scheduled to open in 2020.</p>
<p>The casino will have 3,500 slot machines and 125 gaming tables, as well as a 5,000-seat concert hall, top restaurants, and a luxury hotel. It will be open to the public 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>“This is an historic day for the Clippers organization and our fans,” said team owner Steve Ballmer at the press conference announcing the project. “We are excited to be partnering with such a world-class organization as Caesars Entertainment to bring this amazing resort to life.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Clippers have ventured into the casino business. They already own interests in casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, as well as a racetrack in Alabama. But this will be their first casino resort in their home city of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Bringing a world-class casino resort to Hollywood Park represents a major opportunity for us to drive visitation and create an unparalleled gaming and entertainment experience for our guests from Southern California and around the world,” said Mark Frissora, CEO of Caesars Entertainment Corporation.</p>
<p>The project has already faced some opposition from local residents who are concerned about traffic congestion and crime rates going up. But officials from the Clippers and Caesars Entertainment say that they have taken these concerns into account and have made provisions to address them.</p>
<h1 id="4-Clippers-Look-to-Move-Gambling-Operations-to-LA"><a href="#4-Clippers-Look-to-Move-Gambling-Operations-to-LA" class="headerlink" title="4. Clippers Look to Move Gambling Operations to LA"></a>4. Clippers Look to Move Gambling Operations to LA</h1><p>As the NBA playoffs continue, one team not in the postseason is the Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011 and now they are looking to move their gambling operations from San Francisco to LA.</p>
<p>The Clippers have been in a battle with the Golden State Warriors for years and it looks like they are starting to fall behind. The Warriors have won 3 of the last 4 Championships while the Clippers have only made it to the second round once during that time.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for their struggles has been their gambling operations. The Clippers have been operating out of San Francisco but they may be looking to move them to LA. This would give them an advantage over their rivals as they would be able to operate closer to where most of their fans are located.</p>
<p>The Clippers were recently bought by Steve Ballmer and he is looking for ways to improve the team. This may be his way of doing so as it would give them a major edge over their opponents.</p>
<p>The move is still in its early stages and nothing has been finalized yet. However, it appears that this is something that Ballmer is interested in doing and he could make an announcement in the near future.</p>
<h1 id="5-NBA-Franchise-Eyes-Major-Expansion-into-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#5-NBA-Franchise-Eyes-Major-Expansion-into-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="5. NBA Franchise Eyes Major Expansion into Gambling Industry"></a>5. NBA Franchise Eyes Major Expansion into Gambling Industry</h1><p>The NBA is planning a major expansion into the gambling industry, according to reports.</p>
<p>The league is said to be in talks with several casino companies about becoming partners in an NBA-branded sports betting venture.</p>
<p>This would give the league a significant piece of the booming gambling market, which is expected to reach over $200 billion in size by 2020.</p>
<p>“The NBA has been studying and exploring the various opportunities and implications associated with legalized sports betting for some time,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement.</p>
<p>“As part of that process, we have talked with numerous entities within the gaming industry, including casino operators, equipment providers, fantasy sports companies and others.”</p>
<p>Bass said that while the NBA has not made any final decisions, it is exploring all options for how to best take advantage of legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Several other professional leagues are also looking into expanding into the gambling industry, including the NFL and NHL.</p>
