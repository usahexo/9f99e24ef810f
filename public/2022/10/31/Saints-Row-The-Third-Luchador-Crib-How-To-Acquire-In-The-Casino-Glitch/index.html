<p>The Casino Glitch is a bug in Saints Row The Third that can be used to get any vehicle or weapon in the game.</p>
<p>There are two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>glitch your way into the Casino.</li>
<li>glitch your way out of the Casino with the Luchador Crib.</li>
</ol>
<p>To glitch your way into the Casino, drive a car up to the shutter doors and park it so that it’s half in and half out of the building. Get out of the car and run towards the casino, but jump off the car before you reach it. You should now be inside the casino.</p>
<p>To glitch your way out of the casino with the Luchador Crib, first go to where you would normally pick up cars from mission start points (the yellow markers on your map). There’s a small room next to one of these markers where you can glitch out of the casino. To do this, face the wall next to the door, then sprint towards it and jump at the last second. You should now be outside of the casino, but still in the game world.</p>

<p>The Monster Birds game is a tower defense-style minigame where you have to protect your house from waves of attacking birds. There are five different types of birds, and each one has its own unique attacks and behavior.</p>
<p>The best way to defeat the Monster Birds game is to use your surrounding environment to your advantage. For example, use cars to block the pathways leading to your house, and use dumpsters and other objects to set up defenses around your property.</p>
<p>Additionally, use your weapons and powers wisely. The Molotov Cocktail is great for taking out groups of birds, while the Telekinesis power can be used to pick up objects and throw them at the birds.</p>
<p>Finally, always keep an eye on your health meter and make sure to heal yourself when needed.</p>
<h1 id="Saints-Row-The-Third-Cribs-amp-Customization-Guide"><a href="#Saints-Row-The-Third-Cribs-amp-Customization-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Saints Row The Third - Cribs &amp; Customization Guide"></a>Saints Row The Third - Cribs &amp; Customization Guide</h1><p>In Saints Row The Third, you can purchase and customize a number of properties - your “Crib.” This guide will help you understand everything Crib-related in the game.</p>
<p>There are three types of Cribs in the game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Private Cribs: You start the game with a Private Crib. It’s automatically assigned to you and comes with some default customization options. You can’t purchase or customize other Private Cribs.</li>
<li>Gat’s Crib: After you complete the “Gat Out of Hell” DLC, Gat becomes your Homie and you can purchase his Crib for $10,000. It comes with some default customization options and has a couple of unique features (discussed below). </li>
<li>Production Cribs: These are large, multi-level properties that can be customized to house TV production facilities. There are two Production Cribs in the game and each costs $500,000 to purchase. More information on Production Cribs is included below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of Crib has different customization options:</p>
<p>Private Cribs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Name </li>
<li>Architectural Style (Modern, Classic, Loft, Industrial) </li>
<li>Exterior Wall Material (Brick, Metal, Wood)  </li>

<h1 id="All-you-need-to-know-about-the-Saints-Row-The-Third-Monster-Bird-Game"><a href="#All-you-need-to-know-about-the-Saints-Row-The-Third-Monster-Bird-Game" class="headerlink" title="All you need to know about the Saints Row: The Third Monster Bird Game"></a>All you need to know about the Saints Row: The Third Monster Bird Game</h1><p>The Saints Row: The Third Monster Bird Game is an open world action-adventure video game that was developed by Volition and published by THQ. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2011, and for Microsoft Windows in January 2013. The game is the third installment in the Saints Row series, following 2008’s Saints Row 2.</p>
<p>Set a few years after the events of Saints Row 2, the Third Street Saints have become national celebrities thanks to their tower defense game show franchise “Steelport Hereos”. But when the Earth’s alien overlord Zinyak attacks the city, the Saints are kidnapped and transported to his simulated reality world.</p>
<p>In order to escape, players must fight through countless enemies while descending through four different levels of the simulation. Along the way they’ll unlock new abilities and powerful weapons to help them take down Zinyak and his army of digital henchmen.</p>
<p>Saints Row: The Third Monster Bird Game is a fun, over-the-top action game that provides hours of entertainment. The humor is sophomoric but very funny, and there’s a ton of things to do including stronghold takeovers, races, missions, stunts, etc. While it doesn’t push boundaries or innovate in any way, it does what it does very well and should appeal to fans of games like Grand Theft Auto.</p>
