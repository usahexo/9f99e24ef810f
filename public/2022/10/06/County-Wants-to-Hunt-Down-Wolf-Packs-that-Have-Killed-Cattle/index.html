        <h1 id="County-Wants-to-Hunt-Down-Wolf-Packs-that-Have-Killed-Cattle"><a href="#County-Wants-to-Hunt-Down-Wolf-Packs-that-Have-Killed-Cattle" class="headerlink" title="County Wants to Hunt Down Wolf Packs that Have Killed Cattle"></a>County Wants to Hunt Down Wolf Packs that Have Killed Cattle</h1><p>In the state of Oregon, wolves are listed as an endangered species. However, a county in the northeastern corner of the state has announced their intention to hunt down and kill any wolf packs that have been attacking and killing cattle.</p>
<p>The county commissioner, who is also a local rancher, said that he has lost at least 10 cows to wolf attacks in the last year. He says that it is not fair for his business to suffer because of the wolves and that something needs to be done to protect his livestock.</p>
<p>He is not alone in this sentiment. Many other ranchers in the area have also seen their cattle killed by wolves and are frustrated by what they see as a lack of action on the part of the state government.</p>
<p>There are currently only about 110 wolves living in Oregon, which is far fewer than the population needed for a self-sustaining population. So, while hunting down and killing these animals may seem drastic, it could actually help to boost the wolf population in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="400-000-People-Sign-Petition-to-Stop-the-California-Wolf-Hunt"><a href="#400-000-People-Sign-Petition-to-Stop-the-California-Wolf-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="400,000 People Sign Petition to Stop the California Wolf Hunt"></a>400,000 People Sign Petition to Stop the California Wolf Hunt</h1><p>In what may come as a surprise to some, a recent petition to stop the California wolf hunt has quickly gained traction, with over 400,000 signatures as of the time of writing. Spearheaded by the Environmental Defense Center (EDC), the petition urges Governor Jerry Brown to put an end to the “unwarranted” predator control program that has resulted in the deaths of six gray wolves since December 2017.</p>
<p>“Wolves are an important part of California’s natural heritage and help keep our ecosystems in balance,” said EDC attorney Adrian Martinez in a statement. “It’s time for Governor Brown to put an end to this unwarranted and harmful wolf hunt.”</p>
<p>According to EDC, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is currently undertaking an aggressive program to exterminate wolves in the state, despite their protected status under both state and federal law. CDFW has claimed that the agency is only targeting animals that have preyed on livestock – but environmental groups argue that there is no evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>Gray wolves are currently listed as endangered under both federal and state law, making it illegal to kill them except in cases of self-defense or defense of another person. In December 2017, CDFW classified gray wolves as “game mammals” which allows for their hunting and trapping throughout most of the state.</p>
<p>The petition comes at a time when public opinion on wolf hunting is shifting. In early 2018, a poll conducted by The Associated Press found that 62 percent of Americans opposed shooting wolves from airplanes and helicopters – up from 48 percent in 2016.</p>
<h1 id="Group-Plans-‘Wolf-Free’-Zone-in-Upper-Peninsula"><a href="#Group-Plans-‘Wolf-Free’-Zone-in-Upper-Peninsula" class="headerlink" title="Group Plans ‘Wolf-Free’ Zone in Upper Peninsula"></a>Group Plans ‘Wolf-Free’ Zone in Upper Peninsula</h1><p>Environmental groups announced their intention to create a wolf-free zone in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The proposed area, totaling about 3,000 square miles, is said to be crucial for the survival of moose and other ungulates.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Michigan’s moose and other ungulates,” said Bob Heyd, president of the Wolf-Free Michigan Coalition. “The creation of this wolf-free zone will ensure that these animals have a future in the Upper Peninsula.”</p>
<p>The zone would encompass all or part of 11 counties and would be patrolled by game wardens to ensure that no wolves are present.</p>
<p>“This is not only good for the moose and deer, but it’s also good for the economy,” Heyd said. “If we can keep our ungulates healthy, we’ll see more tourists coming to the Upper Peninsula to hunt and watch them.”</p>
<p>Heyd also dismissed concerns that the absence of wolves would lead to an increase in coyotes and other predators.</p>
<p>“Coyotes are nothing new in the Upper Peninsula,” Heyd said. “They’ve been here for years and they’re not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>The proposal to create a wolf-free zone in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has generated a great deal of controversy. Environmental groups say that the zone is necessary for the survival of moose and other ungulates, while opponents argue that it will lead to an increase in coyotes and other predators.</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Considers-Allowing-Wolf-Hunting-After-Livestock-Deaths"><a href="#Minnesota-Considers-Allowing-Wolf-Hunting-After-Livestock-Deaths" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Considers Allowing Wolf Hunting After Livestock Deaths"></a>Minnesota Considers Allowing Wolf Hunting After Livestock Deaths</h1><p>Minnesota is considering allowing wolf hunting after several livestock deaths have been attributed to the animals. The state’s Department of Natural Resources has identified 24 wolves that it believes are responsible for the deaths of 39 cattle, sheep, and dogs in the past year.</p>
<p>Farmers and ranchers in the area are pushing for a hunt to be allowed, as they feel that the wolves are a threat to their livelihood. However, proponents of wolf conservation argue that the population of wolves in Minnesota is still too low to allow a hunting season. There are approximately 2,000 wolves in the state, down from 3,000 in 2007.</p>
<p>The Department of Natural Resources is expected to make a decision on whether or not to allow a wolf hunt by the end of the year.</p>
<h1 id="Idaho-Considers-Allowing-Wolf-Hunting-to-Address-increasing-predation"><a href="#Idaho-Considers-Allowing-Wolf-Hunting-to-Address-increasing-predation" class="headerlink" title="Idaho Considers Allowing Wolf Hunting to Address increasing predation"></a>Idaho Considers Allowing Wolf Hunting to Address increasing predation</h1><p>Idaho is currently considering a measure that would allow wolf hunting in order to address the increasing predation on livestock. So far, the proposal has generated a lot of controversy, with supporters and opponents evenly split. Proponents of the measure argue that wolf hunting is necessary in order to protect livestock and reduce the population of wolves, while opponents claim that wolf hunting is cruel and unnecessary.</p>
<p>Idaho has been wrestling with the issue of wolf predation for years. There are an estimated 783 wolves in Idaho, and their population is growing rapidly. In addition to preying on livestock, wolves are also known to prey on deer, elk, and other wildlife. As the population of wolves continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly difficult for ranchers to protect their livestock.</p>
<p>In response to this issue, Idaho is considering a measure that would allow wolf hunting. The proposal would allow the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to issue licenses for wolf hunting, with a maximum of 220 licenses allowed per year. The licenses would be valid for a period of one year, and could be used to hunt any wolf within the state. The proposal would also create a $50 bounty for each dead wolf.</p>
<p>So far, the proposal has generated a great deal of controversy. Supporters and opponents are evenly split, with both sides claiming that they have the best interests of Idaho at heart. Supporters of the measure argue that wolf hunting is necessary in order to protect livestock from predation and reduce the overall population of wolves in Idaho. They claim that without this measure, the population of wolves will continue to grow unchecked, putting both livestock and wildlife at risk.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that wolf hunting is cruel and unnecessary. They claim that there are other ways to protect livestock from predation without resorting to lethal measures. Moreover, they argue that wolves play an important role in the ecosystem and should not be hunted down indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The debate over this issue is likely to continue for some time. However, it is clear that Idaho faces some difficult decisions when it comes to managing its exploding population of wolves</p>
